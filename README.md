To simulate the lifecycle of a ticket we start at hte beginning, which is when the ticket is created. For this step I act as a guest user with a problem and fill in my information as well as information for the problems I want to report, in this case I am reporting a problem that the online banking system of a company is down. Using another user I report a problem that the accounting department for a company needs to be upgraded.

<h2>2. Assignment and Communication</h2>

For this next step we look at the tickets from the agents view, after recieving the tickets from the users we open them to observe different aspects such as their priority level, which department they are assigned to, the SLA on it currently and who it is assinged to. After reading the tickets details the agent will then assign it a different priority or SLA(one of the SLAs that was created in the configuration phase). For a tickets like the mobile banking system is down for a whole company, that would get an urgent SLA such as Sev-A. For a problem regarding online banking it would be wise to assign the tickets to the online banking department that wsa created as well. This step is really assessing a tickets, and giving it the correct qualities based on urgency and the nature of the ticket and sending it to the right people to deal with it.
